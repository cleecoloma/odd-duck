# odd-duck
> This repository contains Code Fellows Code 201 Odd-Duck Project (a week long lab). It is a web application where a user can vote/pick a product out of 3 options for 25 voting rounds. It is good to note that a new set of 3 products will be shown at the next instance of voting round. Upon completion of 25 rounds, a View Results button will pop up. When the button is clicked, a bar chart showing the current results of voting will be displayed. This chart will show the times seen and times clicked for each product. Utilizing the local storage, the data from the current voting rounds will be stored and added to the existing data.

## The image below shows the initial home page when the page is loaded
